The Chinese travel agency China Youth Travel Solution (CYTS) issued a statement on Mar. 26 saying that they have suspended bookings with Malaysian Airlines for all current travel to Malaysia. Travelers with existing reservations can ask for a full refund or transfer to other airlines. Ge Lei, the marketing manager of CYTS told a reporter from People's Daily Online: "The missing jet incident has had a considerable impact on the China's travel market to Malaysia. Compared to the same period last year, bookings to Malaysia have ground to a halt."
